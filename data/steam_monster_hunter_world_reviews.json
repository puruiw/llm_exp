The animations and combat mechanics are top-notch, and yes, even the in-game steak grilling song is 😙👌 *chef's kiss*. The game runs smoothly, a testament to its fine optimisation.​\n\nTeaming up with friends, many of whom are newcomers, has been a blast. One buddy, Tobay, even schooled me on game mechanics—talk about a role reversal! However, I must admit, the early-game (and some late-game) weapon designs feel a bit uninspired compared to the unique aesthetics of older titles. It's a minor gripe in an otherwise stellar game.​\n\nNow, if only Monster Hunter Wilds' PC launch was as good as World's.

[/h2]\n\n⠀⠀⠀I have this fantasy where we start talking at the Vanity Fair Oscars party bar. We exchange a few pleasantries—he asks what I do. I say I loved him in Monster Hunter: World. He laughs and I get my drink.\n⠀⠀⠀\"Well, it was a pleasure to meet you,\" I say abruptly and walk away. I've got his attention now. How many guys would voluntarily leave a conversation with Nergigante? He touches his scales impatiently as he watches me leave.\n⠀⠀⠀Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows increasingly loose, he finds me on the balcony, my bow tie undone, smoking a cigarette.\n⠀⠀⠀\"Got a spare?\" he asks cordially. I knew there was something to be had for playing hard to get, but I wasn't expecting it to be so effective this quickly.\n⠀⠀⠀\"What's in it for me?\" I reply as I hand him one of my little white ladies. The lavender lips at the end of his triangular snout form a gentle smile.\n⠀⠀⠀Sarcasm charges his response. \"Conversation with me, duh.\" Sharing his sentiment, I laugh this time, despite feeling somewhat out of my comfort zone. I believe myself to be different from the aforementioned gorgeous narcissists that are so ever-present, but I can’t help but feel as if I’m somewhere I have no place being. There are semantics to a red carpet that fit a different bill than I have ever personally identified with.\n⠀⠀⠀He tilts his head slightly to my right, allowing the pearlescent glow from the golden chandelier above us to give his eyes, in all their amber glory, a sheen that was otherwise not present. \"What's so funny?\" he protests.\n⠀⠀⠀Had my laugh come off as snarky? \"Nothing, nothing... It's just... don't you grow tired of the egos?\"\n⠀⠀⠀\"You get used to it,\" he says, lighting his cigarette and handing me back the lighter. “There’s not always enough fame to go around.” He was a professional—gentle and slow in his movements, not a single ounce of energy wasted. The way he snapped the metal head of my Zippo shut produced a satisfactory click with a different air of authority than I was used to.\n⠀⠀⠀\"What would you do if you weren't a divinely powerful spike-launching dragon?\" I ask. My throat feels the urge to chuckle slightly again, but I stop myself out of a desire for a deeper authenticity to our conversation.\n⠀⠀⠀\"Teaching, I think.\"\n⠀⠀⠀His tail flicks the ground softly—just once—its spikes smacking loudly against the wooden footrest of the barstool. \"And if I was your student, what would I be learning?\"\n⠀⠀⠀\"Discipline,\" he blurts, breaking the eye contact we’d been holding since we started smoking. His tail flicks the oak floor once more as his lips purse together slightly. A small rock shoots from his nose, falling predictably to the floor as it meets an unremarkable oblivion. “Control,” he mutters softly, hastily under his breath, looking back up into my eyes before changing the subject. \"Where are you from?\"\n⠀⠀⠀\"New Zealand,\" I say. I slowly twirl my glass in a circle before setting it down on the counter. It’s hard not to stare at the liquor and the two large ice cubes spinning centrifugally in unison for a few moments. My hands grasp together and I turn in my seat to the right, our eye contact broken again thanks to my decision to stare at the wall of extravagant bottles in front of me instead.\n⠀⠀⠀\"Oh, wow. That's lovely.\"\n⠀⠀⠀\"It's okay,\" I admit. \"Not everything is to my liking.\"\n⠀⠀⠀\"What could possibly be not to your liking in New Zealand?\" he inquires. “The weather, the scenery, the healthcare! I’ve always imagined it to be quite lavish.” His tail flicks against the floor again, then the lower half of his stool. He grabs his bony cauda impatiently and sits it under his right thigh.\n⠀⠀⠀\"I don't like sand,\" I tell him. \"It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.\" It's easy to see some cogs start turning in his head once I say that. Perhaps he's not a fan of sand either? Maybe it bothers his scales?","timestamp_created":1742872799,"timestamp_updated":1742872799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"primarily_steam_deck":false},{"recommendationid":"191128338","author":{"steamid":"76561199094169643","num_games_owned":109,"num_reviews":41,"playtime_forever":8011,"playtime_last_two_weeks":632,"playtime_at_review":6718,"last_played":1744982113},"language":"english","review":"In a perfect world, men like me would not exist.

Id even say it might feel like a turned-based action game, where both you and the monster take your respective turns to punish eachother.\nThankfully, its not a game where you button-mash your way to victory, especially in later fights, you HAVE TO learn monster's moveset and especially your weapon's moveset, otherwise you either fail by carting or just time-out. And it feels great to learn that stuff and improve as a player. And there is alot to learn for each of 14 available weapons, that even after hundred of hours you still might learn new things even about a single weapon you main.\nYou dont get better in the game just by getting better gear or leveling up your stats, you get better in the game by learning its mechanics.\n\nThe monsters design is overall great, especially in Iceborne and its TUs. While there are some outliers, it doesnt take away from the greats like Velkhana, Namielle, Alatreon, Fatalis, Rajangs, Odogarons, Anjanaths, Zinogres and so on and so forth. Id say over half of the roster is great, the other half is either good or good enough. And then there are few like Lavasioths, Zorah and other Leshens, which Id say are just not fun to fight, thankfully you dont have to do most of them multiple times.\nThis is probably the only game where you can kill monster 100s of times and everytime it still feels fun to engage with it.\nI would've never thought that even grind for Decos and Materials might be so fun for hundreds of hours either just by doing Guiding Lands and slaying everything in sight or killing Tempered Teostra 300 times.\n\nDepsite it being a 7 y.o game, it still looks great even now, even in comparison to the 6th gen. And runs great even on mid hardware.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about the game is probably story, but it doesnt take that much time to finish it, and you still get to experience alot of great monsters in there.\n\nIt might be hard to get into, especially if you havent played a game like that before, but its a rewarding experience for sure. You can always try and read in-game tutorials which give you some basic info or just look some more in-depth ones on platforms like YT.\n","timestamp_created":1745177010,"timestamp_updated":1745177010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0.5,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"primarily_steam_deck":false},{"recommendationid":"193210401","author":{"steamid":"76561199008249679","num_games_owned":0,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18375,"playtime_last_two_weeks":6396,"playtime_at_review":18274,"last_played":1745216769},"language":"english","review":"Some times frustrating, but overall one of my favorites videogames saga","timestamp_created":1745176180,"timestamp_updated":1745176180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0.5,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"primarily_steam_deck":false},{"recommendationid":"193202085","author":{"steamid":"76561199574919171","num_games_owned":0,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":12329,"playtime_last_two_weeks":489,"playtime_at_review":12020,"last_played":1745190646},"language":"english","review":"This is a fantastic game, probably my favorite due to its amazing combat system diversity of game play options and styles, and various monsters.

Highly recommend.","timestamp_created":1745169102,"timestamp_updated":1745169102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0.5,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"primarily_steam_deck":false}],"cursor":"AoIFQFaAAAAAAAB1+oDhBQ=="}
