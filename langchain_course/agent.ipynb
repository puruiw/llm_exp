      "Summary: Dragon Ball is a Japanese media franchise created by Akira Toriyama in 1984. The franchise features an ensemble cast of characters and takes place in the same fictional universe as Toriyama's other work, Dr. Slump. While many of the characters are humans with superhuman strengths or supernatural abilities, the cast also includes anthropomorphic animals, extraterrestrial lifeforms, and deities who govern the world and the universe.\n",
      "During the course of the story, protagonist Son Goku is adopted by Grandpa Son Gohan and encounters allies like Bulma, Master Roshi, and Trunks; rivals such as Tien Shinhan, Piccolo, and Vegeta; and villains such as Frieza, Cell, and Majin Buu. Goku's group of associates, known as the \"Dragon Team\" (ドラゴンチーム, Doragon Chīmu),[ch. 165] bolsters its ranks throughout the series with the addition of former enemies and new heroes. The group is also known in Japanese as the \"Z Fighters\" (Z戦士, Zetto Senshi) or Team \"Z\" in other media, and the Earth's Special Forces in the English dub of Dragon Ball Z.\n",

      "Summary: Son Goku  is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun Wukong (known as Son Gokū in Japan and the Monkey King in the West), a main character of the classic 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, combined with influences from the Hong Kong action cinema of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Goku made his debut in the first Dragon Ball chapter, Bulma and Son Goku, originally published in Japan's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984. \n",
      "Goku is introduced as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the seven wish-granting Dragon Balls. Along the way, he finds new friends who follow him on his journey to become stronger. As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of villains with the help of his friends and family, while also gaining new allies in the process. Born under the name Kakarot, as a member of the Saiyan race on Planet Vegeta, he is sent to Earth as an infant prior to his homeworld's destruction at the hands of Frieza. Upon his arrival on Earth, the infant is discovered by Son Gohan, who becomes the adoptive grandfather of the boy and gives him the name Goku. The boy is initially full of violence and aggression due to his Saiyan nature, until an accidental head injury turns him into a cheerful, carefree person. Grandpa Gohan's kindness and teachings help to further influence Goku, who later on names his first son Gohan in honor of him.\n",
      "As the protagonist of Dragon Ball, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z) and sequels (Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball Daima), as well as many of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Goku became one of the most recognizable and iconic manga/anime characters worldwide. Outside the Dragon Ball franchise, Goku has made cameo appearances in Toriyama's self-parody series Neko Majin Z, has been the subject of other parodies, and has appeared in special events. Most Western audiences were introduced to the adult version of Goku featured in the Dragon Ball Z anime, which adapted the final 26 Dragon Ball manga volumes, as opposed to his initial appearance as a child due to the limited success of the first anime series overseas.\n",

The franchise features an ensemble cast of characters and takes place in the same fictional universe as Toriyama's other work, Dr. Slump. While many of the characters are humans with superhuman strengths or supernatural abilities, the cast also includes anthropomorphic animals, extraterrestrial lifeforms, and deities who govern the world and the universe.\\nDuring the course of the story, protagonist Son Goku is adopted by Grandpa Son Gohan and encounters allies like Bulma, Master Roshi, and Trunks; rivals such as Tien Shinhan, Piccolo, and Vegeta; and villains such as Frieza, Cell, and Majin Buu. Goku's group of associates, known as the \\\"Dragon Team\\\" (ドラゴンチーム, Doragon Chīmu),[ch. 165] bolsters its ranks throughout the series with the addition of former enemies and new heroes.

He is based on Sun Wukong (known as Son Gokū in Japan and the Monkey King in the West), a main character of the classic 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, combined with influences from the Hong Kong action cinema of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Goku made his debut in the first Dragon Ball chapter, Bulma and Son Goku, originally published in Japan's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984. \\nGoku is introduced as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the seven wish-granting Dragon Balls. Along the way, he finds new friends who follow him on his journey to become stronger. As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of villains with the help of his friends and family, while also gaining new allies in the process. Born under the name Kakarot, as a member of the Saiyan race on Planet Vegeta, he is sent to Earth as an infant prior to his homeworld's destruction at the hands of Frieza. Upon his arrival on Earth, the infant is discovered by Son Gohan, who becomes the adoptive grandfather of the boy and gives him the name Goku. The boy is initially full of violence and aggression due to his Saiyan nature, until an accidental head injury turns him into a cheerful, carefree person. Grandpa Gohan's kindness and teachings help to further influence Goku, who later on names his first son Gohan in honor of him.\\nAs the protagonist of Dragon Ball, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z) and sequels (Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball Daima), as well as many of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Goku became one of the most recognizable and iconic manga/anime characters worldwide. Outside the Dragon Ball franchise, Goku has made cameo appearances in Toriyama's self-parody series Neko Majin Z, has been the subject of other parodies, and has appeared in special events. Most Western audiences were introduced to the adult version of Goku featured in the Dragon Ball Z anime, which adapted the final 26 Dragon Ball manga volumes, as opposed to his initial appearance as a child due to the limited success of the first anime series overseas.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Piccolo (Dragon Ball)\\nSummary: Piccolo (Japanese: ピッコロ, Hepburn: Pikkoro) is a fictional character in the Japanese Dragon Ball media franchise created by Akira Toriyama.

He is based on Sun Wukong (known as Son Gokū in Japan and the Monkey King in the West), a main character of the classic 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, combined with influences from the Hong Kong action cinema of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Goku made his debut in the first Dragon Ball chapter, Bulma and Son Goku, originally published in Japan's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984. \\nGoku is introduced as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the seven wish-granting Dragon Balls. Along the way, he finds new friends who follow him on his journey to become stronger. As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of villains with the help of his friends and family, while also gaining new allies in the process. Born under the name Kakarot, as a member of the Saiyan race on Planet Vegeta, he is sent to Earth as an infant prior to his homeworld's destruction at the hands of Frieza. Upon his arrival on Earth, the infant is discovered by Son Gohan, who becomes the adoptive grandfather of the boy and gives him the name Goku. The boy is initially full of violence and aggression due to his Saiyan nature, until an accidental head injury turns him into a cheerful, carefree person. Grandpa Gohan's kindness and teachings help to further influence Goku, who later on names his first son Gohan in honor of him.\\nAs the protagonist of Dragon Ball, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z) and sequels (Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball Daima), as well as many of the franchise's video games.

      "        \"text\": \"It seems the search for the specific locations of Frieza arc episodes in Dragon Ball Z has led to information about the production and release details rather than the geographic or narrative locations within the series. To provide more directly relevant information, let's summarize the key narrative locations from the Namek Saga (Frieza Arc) in Dragon Ball Z:\\n\\n1. **Vegeta Planet**: The saga begins on Vegeta, where the Saiyan soldiers are preparing to attack Earth. Vegeta is also a battleground for many of the Saiyan warriors.\\n\\n2. **Namek (Planet Namek)**: The Namekians serve as key characters and provide information about Frieza's past. The Namekian Dragon Balls hold significant power and play crucial roles in the plot, especially when used to resurrect various characters.\\n\\n3. **Earth**: After the initial Saiyan attack on Earth, the Z Fighters defend their planet against further attacks from Frieza's men. Key battles occur at various locations around the world, such as Namekian villages and even in space.\\n\\n4. **Other Locations**: Throughout the arc, there are several important spaceships and battlefields where significant fights take place, including a ship docked in outer space where Goku and Vegeta engage Frieza directly. Additionally, there are scenes on Namek where various Z Fighters train and strategize.\\n\\nFor more detailed episode information, you would need to look at the specific episode summaries from official Dragon Ball Z guides or databases that provide this level of detail. If you're looking for a quick reference, here's how these locations play out in the timeline:\\n\\n- **Vegeta Planet**: Episodes 90–146.\\n- **Earth**: Episodes 90 (beginning), 235–281.\\n- **Planet Namek**: Episodes 237–252 and 260–281.\\n\\nThese episodes cover the primary action on these locations. If you need a more granular breakdown or specific scenes, I recommend checking out episode guides from official sources like Funimation or Viz Media (for the English dubs and subtitlings respectively).\",\n",

Key battles occur at various locations around the world, such as Namekian villages and even in space.\\n\\n4. **Other Locations**: Throughout the arc, there are several important spaceships and battlefields where significant fights take place, including a ship docked in outer space where Goku and Vegeta engage Frieza directly.

To provide more directly relevant information, let's summarize the key narrative locations from the Namek Saga (Frieza Arc) in Dragon Ball Z:\n\n1. **Vegeta Planet**: The saga begins on Vegeta, where the Saiyan soldiers are preparing to attack Earth. Vegeta is also a battleground for many of the Saiyan warriors.\n\n2. **Namek (Planet Namek)**: The Namekians serve as key characters and provide information about Frieza's past. The Namekian Dragon Balls hold significant power and play crucial roles in the plot, especially when used to resurrect various characters.\n\n3. **Earth**: After the initial Saiyan attack on Earth, the Z Fighters defend their planet against further attacks from Frieza's men. Key battles occur at various locations around the world, such as Namekian villages and even in space.\n\n4. **Other Locations**: Throughout the arc, there are several important spaceships and battlefields where significant fights take place, including a ship docked in outer space where Goku and Vegeta engage Frieza directly. Additionally, there are scenes on Namek where various Z Fighters train and strategize.\n\nFor more detailed episode information, you would need to look at the specific episode summaries from official Dragon Ball Z guides or databases that provide this level of detail. If you're looking for a quick reference, here's how these locations play out in the timeline:\n\n- **Vegeta Planet**: Episodes 90–146.\n- **Earth**: Episodes 90 (beginning), 235–281.\n- **Planet Namek**: Episodes 237–252 and 260–281.\n\nThese episodes cover the primary action on these locations. If you need a more granular breakdown or specific scenes, I recommend checking out episode guides from official sources like Funimation or Viz Media (for the English dubs and subtitlings respectively).`\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE ",

This is the error: Could not parse LLM output: `It seems the search for the specific locations of Frieza arc episodes in Dragon Ball Z has led to information about the production and release details rather than the geographic or narrative locations within the series. To provide more directly relevant information, let's summarize the key narrative locations from the Namek Saga (Frieza Arc) in Dragon Ball Z:\n\n1. **Vegeta Planet**: The saga begins on Vegeta, where the Saiyan soldiers are preparing to attack Earth. Vegeta is also a battleground for many of the Saiyan warriors.\n\n2. **Namek (Planet Namek)**: The Namekians serve as key characters and provide information about Frieza's past. The Namekian Dragon Balls hold significant power and play crucial roles in the plot, especially when used to resurrect various characters.\n\n3. **Earth**: After the initial Saiyan attack on Earth, the Z Fighters defend their planet against further attacks from Frieza's men. Key battles occur at various locations around the world, such as Namekian villages and even in space.\n\n4. **Other Locations**: Throughout the arc, there are several important spaceships and battlefields where significant fights take place, including a ship docked in outer space where Goku and Vegeta engage Frieza directly. Additionally, there are scenes on Namek where various Z Fighters train and strategize.\n\nFor more detailed episode information, you would need to look at the specific episode summaries from official Dragon Ball Z guides or databases that provide this level of detail. If you're looking for a quick reference, here's how these locations play out in the timeline:\n\n- **Vegeta Planet**: Episodes 90–146.\n- **Earth**: Episodes 90 (beginning), 235–281.\n- **Planet Namek**: Episodes 237–252 and 260–281.\n\nThese episodes cover the primary action on these locations. If you need a more granular breakdown or specific scenes, I recommend checking out episode guides from official sources like Funimation or Viz Media (for the English dubs and subtitlings respectively).`\nFor troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE "
